    <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>
    <h4>The Library in Lord Goringâ€™s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.</h4>

        <h5>LORD GORING</h5><br>
          <p>Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p><br>

       <h5> PHIPPS</h5><br>
       <p>Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p><br>

       <h5> LORD GORING</h5>
        <p>distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.</p><br>

        <h5>PHIPPS</h5>
         <p>Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p><br>

        <h5>LORD GORING</h5>
         <p>[_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p><br>

        <h5>PHIPPS</h5>
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p><br>

        <h5>LORD GORING</h5>
        <p>Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.</p><br>

        <h5>PHIPPS</h5>
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p><br>

        <h5>LORD GORING</h5>
        <p>[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
         of other people.</p><br>

        <h5>PHIPPS</h5>
        <p>Yes, my lord.</p><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        "LORD GORING.  [_Rising from his chair_.]""
    </p>
    "I was waiting for you to say
    that, Robert.  It is the only thing to do now.  And you must begin by
    telling your wife the whole story."
