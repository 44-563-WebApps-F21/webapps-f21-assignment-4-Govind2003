    <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>
    <h4>The Library in Lord Goringâ€™s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
        the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
        smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
        drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
        some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
        impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
        Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
        intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
        the dominance of form_.</h4>

        LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?<br>

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
        presents new buttonhole on salver_.]<br>

        LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
        of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole.<br>

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.<br>

        LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
        what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.<br>

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people.<br>

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

        LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
         of other people.<br>

        PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>
